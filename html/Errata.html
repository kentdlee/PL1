<ul>
  <li>The rules used for deriving attributes are misnumbered. All rules in the solution to this practice problem that are greater than or equal to 8 must have 1 subtracted from them. For instance, in the <strong>R</strong> AST node, rule <strong>12</strong> should be rule <strong>11</strong> and rule <strong>11</strong> should be rule <strong>10</strong>.</li>

<H1>Layers Upon Layers</H1>
<P>This picture was taken while ascending to Gunsight Pass in Glacier National Park. The layers you see are metamorphic rock that have been pushed up
by forces within the earth. The layers remind me that Computer Science is possible because of the work others have done. The layers below are
all the work that has gone before. The study of Programming Languages can help us understand some of these layers as they apply to Computer Science. 
The more we understand the tools we use, the better we are at using those tools. </div>
